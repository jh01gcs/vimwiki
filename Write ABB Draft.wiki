Dear Sir,

Have you given up on this project sir?

I have designed my factory keeping you and your standards in mind (and they are a genuine standand to uphold to). In the process, we got best of the machines and have instituted much better processes.

Over the course of 1 year, I have reached out to you on multiple occasions to initiate the association and continue to work for you like I have for the past 12 years. However, I have failed in my attempts to reach you in a meaningful way.

I can of course provide you better cost and better quality. There is just no doubt about it.

With pain, I am forced to ask, have you given up on this project?

Best
Ajay Mehta
