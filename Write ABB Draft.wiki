Dear Sir,

Over the Course of 1 year, I have reached out to you on multiple occasions to get associated with you and continue to work for you. However, I have failed in my attempts to reach you in a meaningful way.

I have designed my factory keeping you and your standards in mind, in the process, getting best of the machines and instituting best of the processes.

Have you given up on this project sir?

Best
Ajay Mehta
